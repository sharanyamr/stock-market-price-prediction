Project Title:
Build a Stock Market Prediction Web Application using Flask, PostgreSQL, yFinance, and Twitter API with full frontend in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap 5.



> Core Features:



Stock Price Prediction using machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Linear Regression) based on historical data fetched from yfinance.

Sentiment Analysis using Twitter API (tweepy) to analyze public tweets about stocks and predict market sentiment.

Allow users to post comments on stocks' sentiment results and reply to comments (like threaded discussions).

Stock Trading Simulation: Users can buy and sell stocks manually in their portfolio using real-time prices (fetched from yfinance).

Portfolio Management Dashboard: Show users their holdings, stock quantities, average buy price, current price, portfolio value, and profits/losses.

Education Section: Create a blog or article page where users can read educational articles about investing and stock markets.

News Section: Fetch and display the latest stock market news articles (use any free news API like NewsAPI.org).

Currency Converter: Add a simple currency conversion tool using an external API like ExchangeRate-API or Fixer.io.

Live Stock Tickers: Add a ticker tape at the top of the page showing live stock symbols and prices.

User Authentication: Login, Register, Logout using Flask sessions.

Admin Panel: To manage articles, users, and moderate comments.


> Database:
Use PostgreSQL with tables for:



users

portfolio

sentiment_comments

sentiment_replies

education_articles

news_articles


> Backend Stack:



Flask

yFinance

Tweepy (for Twitter API)

SQLAlchemy (ORM) or psycopg2 (direct PostgreSQL connection)

Machine Learning Libraries: sklearn, statsmodels, keras (for ARIMA, LSTM, etc.)


> Frontend Stack:



HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Bootstrap 5

Chart.js (for stock charts)

AJAX (for smoother comment replies or ticker updates)


> Bonus (optional):



Add Dark Mode toggle.

Use Flask-Admin for admin dashboards.

Add email notifications when prediction models detect strong Buy/Sell signals.
